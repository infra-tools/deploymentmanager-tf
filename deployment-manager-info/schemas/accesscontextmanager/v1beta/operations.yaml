            This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
            network API call.

                If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
                If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
                available.

                type: any
              description: |-
                Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
                contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
                Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
                long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
              type: object
            name:
              description: |-
                The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
                originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
                `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
              type: string
            response:
              additionalProperties:
                description: Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type
                  URL.
                type: any
              description: |-
                The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
                method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
                `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
                `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
                methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
                is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
                is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
                `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

            The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
            different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
            used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
            three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.

            You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
            [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

                user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
                google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
