            `AccessPolicy` is a container for `AccessLevels` (which define the necessary
            attributes to use GCP services) and `ServicePerimeters` (which define regions
            of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An access policy is
            globally visible within an organization, and the restrictions it specifies
            apply to all projects within an organization.
