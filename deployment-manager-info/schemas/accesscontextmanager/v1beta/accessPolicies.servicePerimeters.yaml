            and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
            `ServicePerimeter`. If a request with a source within this `ServicePerimeter`
            has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request will be blocked.
            Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter -
            Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single GCP
            project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
            Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP
            project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.
