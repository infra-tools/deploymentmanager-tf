              - Most recent renewal failed due to an invalid DNS setup and will be
                retried. Renewal attempts will continue to fail until the certificate
                domain's DNS configuration is fixed. The last successfully provisioned
                certificate may still be serving.
              - All renewal attempts have been exhausted, likely due to an invalid
                DNS setup.
              - Most recent renewal failed due to an explicit CAA record that does
                not include the in-use CA, Let's Encrypt. Renewals will continue to
                fail until the CAA is reconfigured. The last successfully provisioned
                certificate may still be serving.
              - Most recent renewal failed due to a CAA retrieval failure. This means
                that the domain's DNS provider does not properly handle CAA records,
                failing requests for CAA records when no CAA records are defined.
                Renewals will continue to fail until the DNS provider is changed or
                a CAA record is added for the given domain. The last successfully
                provisioned certificate may still be serving.
