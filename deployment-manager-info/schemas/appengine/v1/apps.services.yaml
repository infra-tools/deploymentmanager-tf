        Service:
          description: A Service resource is a logical component of an application
            that can share state and communicate in a secure fashion with other services.
            For example, an application that handles customer requests might include
            separate services to handle tasks such as backend data analysis or API
            requests from mobile devices. Each service has a collection of versions
            that define a specific set of code used to implement the functionality
            of that service.

          description: Traffic routing configuration for versions within a single

                be specified only once, but some versions in the service may not have
                any traffic allocation. Services that have traffic allocated cannot
                be deleted until either the service is deleted or their traffic allocation
                is removed. Allocations must sum to 1. Up to two decimal place precision
                is supported for IP-based splits and up to three decimal places is
                supported for cookie-based splits.

                type until allocations are changed.

              enumDescriptions:
              - Diversion method unspecified.
              - Diversion based on a specially named cookie, "GOOGAPPUID." The cookie
                must be set by the application itself or no diversion will occur.
              - Diversion based on applying the modulus operation to a fingerprint
                of the IP address.
              - Diversion based on weighted random assignment. An incoming request
                is randomly routed to a version in the traffic split, with probability
                proportional to the version's traffic share.
