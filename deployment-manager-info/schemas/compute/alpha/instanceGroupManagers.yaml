              For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

However, if a zonal managed instance group has only one instance, or a regional managed instance group has only one instance per zone, autohealing will recreate these instances when they become unhealthy.
