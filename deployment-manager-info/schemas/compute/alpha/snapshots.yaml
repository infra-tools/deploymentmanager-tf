                After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the image later For example, you must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from the encrypted snapshot in a future request.

                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.

                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot, then the snapshot will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.
