              For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

              The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

        Route:
          description: |-
            Represents a Route resource. A route specifies how certain packets should be handled by the network. Routes are associated with instances by tags and the set of routes for a particular instance is called its routing table.

            For each packet leaving an instance, the system searches that instance's routing table for a single best matching route. Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by the nextHop field of the winning route - either to another instance destination, an instance gateway, or a Google Compute Engine-operated gateway.

            Packets that do not match any route in the sending instance's routing table are dropped. (== resource_for beta.routes ==) (== resource_for v1.routes ==)
