              After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).

              Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.

              If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

                A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this disk, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.

                To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a disk.

                Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system image:

                To create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image name in the following format:
                global/images/my-custom-image


                You can also specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name:
