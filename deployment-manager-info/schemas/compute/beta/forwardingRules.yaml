              The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.

              Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).

              When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.

              When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, this must be a URL reference to an existing Address resource ( internal regional static IP address), with a purpose of GCE_END_POINT and address_type of INTERNAL.

              When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

              An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid:

              Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.

              For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

              The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
