            description: |-
              The `parent` parameter's value depends on the target resource for the
              request, namely
              [`projects`](/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles) or
              [`organizations`](/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles). Each
              resource type's `parent` value format is described below:

              * [`projects.roles.create()`](/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles/create):
                `projects/{PROJECT_ID}`. This method creates project-level
                [custom roles](/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles).
                Example request URL:
                `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles`

              * [`organizations.roles.create()`](/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles/create):
                `organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}`. This method creates organization-level
                [custom roles](/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles). Example request
                URL:
                `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles`

              Note: Wildcard (*) values are invalid; you must specify a complete project
              ID or organization ID.
