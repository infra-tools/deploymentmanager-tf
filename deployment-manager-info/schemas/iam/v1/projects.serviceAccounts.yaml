            A service account in the Identity and Access Management API.

            To create a service account, specify the `project_id` and the `account_id`
            for the account.  The `account_id` is unique within the project, and is used
            to generate the service account email address and a stable
            `unique_id`.

            If the account already exists, the account's resource name is returned
            in the format of projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}. The caller
            can use the name in other methods to access the account.

            All other methods can identify the service account using the format
            `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
            Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
            the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
            `unique_id` of the service account.
