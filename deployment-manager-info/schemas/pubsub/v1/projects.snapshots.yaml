            A snapshot resource. Snapshots are used in
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Seek</a>
            operations, which allow
            you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the
            acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state
            captured by a snapshot.

                The snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time.
                A newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the time of its
                creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing
                backlog in the source subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the
                snapshot is `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`.
                For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days
                old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which
                will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot
                exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a
                snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation.
