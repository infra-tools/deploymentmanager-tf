        MonitoredResourceDescriptor:
          description: An object that describes the schema of a MonitoredResource
            object using a type name and a set of labels. For example, the monitored
            resource descriptor for Google Compute Engine VM instances has a type
            of "gce_instance" and specifies the use of the labels "instance_id" and
            "zone" to identify particular VM instances.Different APIs can support
            different monitored resource types. APIs generally provide a list method
            that returns the monitored resource descriptors used by the API.

              enumDescriptions:
              - Do not use this default value.
              - Early Access features are limited to a closed group of testers. To
                use these features, you must sign up in advance and sign a Trusted
                Tester agreement (which includes confidentiality provisions). These
                features may be unstable, changed in backward-incompatible ways, and
                are not guaranteed to be released.
              - "Alpha is a limited availability test for releases before they are\
                \ cleared for widespread use. By Alpha, all significant design issues\
                \ are resolved and we are in the process of verifying functionality.\
                \ Alpha customers need to apply for access, agree to applicable terms,\
                \ and have their projects whitelisted. Alpha releases don\u2019t have\
                \ to be feature complete, no SLAs are provided, and there are no technical\
                \ support obligations, but they will be far enough along that customers\
                \ can actually use them in test environments or for limited-use tests\
                \ -- just like they would in normal production cases."
              - Beta is the point at which we are ready to open a release for any
                customer to use. There are no SLA or technical support obligations
                in a Beta release. Products will be complete from a feature perspective,
                but may have some open outstanding issues. Beta releases are suitable
                for limited production use cases.
              - GA features are open to all developers and are considered stable and
                fully qualified for production use.
              - "Deprecated features are scheduled to be shut down and removed. For\
                \ more information, see the \u201CDeprecation Policy\u201D section\
                \ of our Terms of Service (https://cloud.google.com/terms/) and the\
