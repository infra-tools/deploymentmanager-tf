              The location where this cluster's nodes and storage reside. For best
              performance, clients should be located as close as possible to this
              cluster. Currently only zones are supported, so values should be of the

              The cluster is currently being resized, and may revert to its previous
              node count if the process encounters an error.
              A cluster is still capable of serving requests while being resized,
              but may exhibit performance as if its number of allocated nodes is
              between the starting and requested states.

              The cluster has no backing nodes. The data (tables) still
