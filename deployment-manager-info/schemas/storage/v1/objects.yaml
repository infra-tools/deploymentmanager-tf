          eventBasedHold:
            description: Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based
              hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified
              by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being
              released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level
              retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to
              hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full.
              Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being
              paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for
              any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on
              the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means
              retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based
              hold transitioned from true to false.

                by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being
                released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level
                retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks
                to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in
                full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the
                loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held
                intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based
                hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that.
                That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment
                event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
